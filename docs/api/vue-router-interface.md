#### isReady

Returns a Promise that resolves when the router has completed the initial navigation, which means it has resolved all async enter hooks and async components that are associated with the initial route. If the initial navigation already happened, the promise resolves immediately.This is useful in server-side rendering to ensure consistent output on both the server and the client. Note that on server side, you need to manually push the initial location while on client side, the router automatically picks it up from the URL.

### Methods

### Properties

```

#### instances

Mounted route component instances Having the instances on the record mean beforeRouteUpdate and beforeRouteLeave guards can only be invoked with the latest mounted app instance if there are multiple application instances rendering the same view, basically duplicating the content on the page, which shouldn't happen in practice.

path: _RouteRecordBase['path']
```

#### props

**Signature:**

```typescript
props: Record<string, _RouteRecordProps>;
```

#### redirect

Where to redirect if the route is directly matched. The redirection happens before any navigation guard and triggers a new navigation with the new target location.
